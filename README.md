# revit-vrsketch-plugin

The VRSketch plugin for Revit.  This should include all you need to compile it from sources.  It does not include the whole separate VR Sketch itself, but just uses it, either on PC for PC VR or on a standalone Quest/PicoNeo headset.

See instructions in [VRSketch/README.txt](VRSketch/README.txt).
